<h2 class="section-heading">Joanna's Awesome Bio</h2>

<p>Hi there, my name is Joanna Khachikian and I am a founder of Topophi. I love spending my free time hiking, backpacking, running and doing yoga. I love baking chocolate chip cookies and eating them. </p>

<p>My first backpacking trip was about a year ago and five backpacking trips later it has become my favorite hobby.  What I love about backpacking is how I am so far away from society and how the stars get so much brighter. I love getting stuck in difficult situations, and only having what is in you backpack to get out of it. I love the food when backpacking, for some reason everything tastes so much better! If you have ever backpacked you know how trail mix becomes gold. </p>

<p> I am really excited about Topophi and our mission to help people just like us get into the outdoors.  It is important to know what you need, and how to care for the forest.  I have been a victim of trying to plan trips and current websites taking me in circles to find permits and information. I know how frustrating it can be, and we are going to make it so much easier by connecting all the necessary tools to get you in the backcountry easily and quickly.</p>
