<h2 class="section-heading">Joanna's Awesome Bio</h2>

<p>Hi there, my name is Joanna Khachikian and I am a founder of Topophi. I love spending my free time hiking, backpacking, running and doing yoga. I love baking chocolate chip cookies and eating them. </p>

<p>My first backpacking trip was about a year ago and now I am in love. I have been always been a hiker, but I never spent the night in the back country. I have now been on 5 different backpacking trips and can't wait for the next one. What I love about backpacking is how I am so far away from society and the stars get so much brighter. I love getting stuck in situations, and only having what is in you backpack to get you out of it. I love the food when backpacking, for some reason everything tastes so much better! Its seriously amazing, trail mix becomes gold. </p>

<p> I am really excited about Topophi and how we are going to be helping people just like us get into the outdoors. I have been a victim of government websites taking me in circles to find permits. I know how frustrating it can be, and we are going to make it so much easier to get the information you need to get in the back country.</p>
