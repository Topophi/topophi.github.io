<h2>It starts</h2>

<p>
Well, how do I begin a bio about myself? I can jump into my life from when Topophi began as the brain child of Joanna and Joel.  Or I can start from when I began working in the conservation field.  Or I can simply begin from the start of it all and speed through the boring parts leading to here.   
</p>
<p>
The fact that I am standing here is pretty awesome, considering that I was wasn't breathing and had to be revived at birth. Luckily I made it will only a minor disability that has given me a different perspective than most. I started life dragging myself across the floor with one arm, not letting something as trivial as that stop me from exploring what little I could at that age.   
</p>
<p>
I was raised in Northern California in the shade of redwoods and the sound of a waterfall in the winter.  My family owned 50 acres of land where my brother, myself, and our dog got to explore to our hearts extent.  We saw every star at night and smog was something I only saw in movies that took place in LA. Life was good.  My parents, not begin from the area themselves, always encouraged new experiences and getting away from what was comfortable. 
</p>
<p>
I left my home town the first time to go to school in Orange County. A far stretch from where I was raised.  I went from not having any neighbors to living in a building with 80 people.  I went from knowing everyone in town to a school with a student population bigger than my home country's.  It was different. I will never forget telling stories about seeing bears and other wildlife at home and hearing people say “There are bears in California?!” I learned that the outdoors is something a lot of people don't get to experience and that I was lucky enough to have been raised outside.  
</p>
<p>
After 4 years of not knowing what I wanted to be when I grew up I joined Americorps NCCC.  This was one of the greatest decisions I have ever made.  As it got me out of California and gave me experiences that I never would have had a chance to do any other way.  Over the course of 10 months I worked in Colorado, Texas, Nevada, Missouri, and New Mexico. NCCC was also the first year where I had the privilege to work in the conservation field.  I completed fish rearing surveys, cranked out miles of trail, stacked cairns, and built fence in canyons in the Arizona strip. I cleared invasive species (damn you salt cedar!) in the desert and along the bank of the Rio Grande.  I also had the privilege to go caving in New Mexico. (cavers don't use the word spelunking) All of this work outside was amazing.  I remember how foreign a lot of this was for people, but I felt right at home.  Life was good. 
</p>
<p>
I was a week away from Starting Grad School in a city I didn't want to live in to get a Masters in something I no longer cared about.  That is when I decided to be a Crew Leader for the Montana Conservation Corps.  MCC was easily one of the greatest times I have ever had, some wouldn't say this  because of all the hardships. However, I think it was great because of the hardships.  I was in the best shape of my life and teaching people the values of conservation while co-leading a saw and trail crew in North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho.  Life was good.  I was looking into going into forestry and maybe join a fire crew at the end of the program.  That was until about halfway through MCC.  I remember pain slowly setting in throughout my body and feeling more and more lethargic every week.  I fought through all of the pain and misery for the second half. I figured I needed more rest and that I was working too hard.  The last couple of months of the program were the second hardest time of my life.  The only reason the time in MCC wasn't the worste was because I was outside, I was surrounded by natural beauty and friends.
</p>
<p>
When MCC was over, the worste time in my life began.  My pain and misery just got exponentially worse.  I couldn't stand up in the morning without a prep talk to myself and 30 minutes of warming up.  Some days were better, but life was not good. In fact it was the opposite of good.  I was in and out of the doctors office 2 times a week getting test after test after test to see why I was no longer able to join a fire crew. After going to the best in the business I found that all I need is a shot once a week and I can feel as close to normal as possible.  It wasn't a cure, but rather a pause button for my disease.  Now the question was there.  What do I do with my life, what do I do from here? I was still recovering for about a year when Stephen gave me the idea to try programming.  I was hooked. I never saw myself at a desk all day, but I enjoyed the work.  And it leaves enough free time to make it all worth it.  
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to now, to Topophi. A side project hopefully turned full time job depending on what happens.  It is more than enjoyable to hypothesis what this could become.  We can make getting outside easier and more enjoyable for anyone interested.  We can kickstart a backpacking revolution that can shake the forests and parks from the ground up. We can get more people outside, healthier, and happier.  We can help people discover how amazing this country’s natural beauty is. From there, I can see a growth in interest for future conservation efforts, and a growth in a more eco friendly lifestyle. 
</p>
<p>
But, that is all just a hypothesis.
