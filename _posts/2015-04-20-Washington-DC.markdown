<h2 class="section-heading">Washington D.C.</h2>

<p>It was a little over a month ago when Topophi found out that the U.S. Department of the Interior was holding a hackathon to show off the capabilities of its newly released database. The database contains all campsite information managed by the U.S. government. I will be the first to admit that I was uneasy about committing to traveling to Washington D.C. to present our unfinished product. I knew that it would cost a lot of money and more importantly the precious vacation time I would rather spend backpacking. We sweated it out for a day, and the team got together and we purchased our tickets to visit our nation’s capital.</p>

<p> After purchasing the tickets, it was time to get to work. Joel, Joanna, Stephen and I went gangbusters making Topophi presentable. After taking a step back to look at what we had accomplished in such a short time, I was stoked! We had a product that was doing exactly what we wanted. We had built this from ground up and it felt amazing!</p>

<p>We woke up at 2:00AM to make our flight to D.C. Man that was rough.  Finally, we were in DC, we dropped off our bags, grabbed some amazing Ethiopian food and drank some Ethiopian beer.  After dinner, we walked around the town and did a quick tour of the American Mall. To our surprise, it happened to be the Cherry Blossom festival in D.C. that weekend. All the cherry blossom trees were bright and beautiful.</p>

<p>The first day of the hackathon we were all a bit nervous.  We found our way to the Department of Interior near the White House and got to work.  We met a lot of nice people throughout the day.  There were many people working hard on their projects. The spirit of hard work and ingenuity was inspiring. At the happy hour that night, we got to meet some people from the hacathone. It was great sharing a drink with everyone there. The people we met had the same passion and love for the outdoors as we do. This hackathon was different from any I have been to, there was no mention of the financial viability of the products, or how to maximize their revenue. All that mattered was how this would get people into the wilderness. It was refreshing to not have a venture capitalist/business approach when presenting an idea. Saturday ended with eating pizza in our hotel lobby to avoid paying for the internet in our room.</p>

<p>Sunday morning we had an opportunity to show off our product during a workshop where we would receive feedback to refine our presentation later in the day. It was awesome to see people excited by our idea. They wanted to know more about us where we wanted Topophi to end up. It was clear that our mailing list requests were going to go up exponentially from this workshop alone. Seeing the excitement raised our spirits and set a great tone for the final presentation. 
</p> <br>
<p>Presentations began at 3pm and there were many great teams with some awesome ideas. It was finally our turn and, after presenting our idea there was a lot of great feedback.  We talked about sharing data, helping others, and creating a connection between Topophi and people who care about our forests.  Our mission is to guide people into the backcountry with the right tools and knowledge they need and we are going to kick ass doing it.

<p>Sunday ended with a jaunt through the American Mall during the year’s most beautiful weekend in D.C. Our trip ended with an amazing meal at Old Ebbits. (Which I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone visiting Washington D.C.)</p>
<br>
<p>As I type this in the Houston Airport during my layover going home, I can say that the trip to Washington was awesome. The hackathon and all the great people we met is going to push the team and me to work harder than ever to complete Topophi for release.</p>

<blockquote>“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”
