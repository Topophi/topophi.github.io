<h2 class="section-heading">Amazing Macaroni and Cheese</h2>

<p> This is one of my favorite dishes after a 10 mile hike in the back country. And this is also one of my favorite parts about backpacking. I love it when its time to get cooking, everyone finds a job and we work together to make the greatest meal. I love when everyone is sitting around the fire stuffing their faces , passing around the whiskey by the fire, telling stories and laughing. I want to share this recipe because it is delicious and it think it is pretty simple for all. </p>

<p> I like to use Trader Joeâ€™s Macaroni because they have 2 styles, one is with a white cheddar and the other is with a Wisconsin cheddar and together it is amazing. However, I am sure that any mac & cheese box will do.  </p>

<span>**Ingredients** </span><br/>
<span>**1 box-** Trader Joe's Organic Shells & White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese</span> <br/> <span>**1 box-** Trader Joe's Wisconsin Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese</span> <br/> <span>**1 pkg-** Sun Dried Tomatoes</span> <br/> <span>**1/2 cup-** Dried Powder Milk </span> <br/> 
<span>**Cholula if desired-** I always desire </span> <br/> 


**How to Pack** 
<p>When packing all the ingredients take the macaroni from both boxes and mix together in a ziplock bag.</p>

<p>Same with the powder mix, dried milk and sun dried tomatoes. Pour out the dried mixes, measure out the milk and add the sun dried tomatoes and combine in one ziplock bag.</p>

<p>This makes for less trash when you are in the backcountry. Always follow the rule: Pack it in, Pack it out</p> 

**Directions**
<p> Boil your water in the jet boil or if you are lucky with your pot over the fire. Once there is a boil then add in all macaroni and let cook for about 6-7min. Taste the macaroni and make sure it is to your liking. Next, walk your jet boil or pot about 20ft away from where you are sleeping and pout out most of the water, leaving about 1/2cup to mix in the powder.</p>

<p>Mix in the powder with sun dried tomatoes and this is why you are going to be glad you got the powder milk. This really gives your mac & cheese the creamy texture everyone loves. Once you are done with the mixing it is time to eat. Dont forget the cholula, it really gives it a good touch.</p>
