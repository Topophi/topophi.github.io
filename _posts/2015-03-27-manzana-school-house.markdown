<p>The Los Padres National Forest lays right behind the Santa Barabra and is a great place for camping, horseback riding, day hiking and backpacking.
It has become a tradition to go backpacking on my birthday and we decided to tackle a one-night trip to the Manzana School House because of the time constraint. We parked up at the Nira Campground and let me tell you the drive there is not an easy one. Joel on the other hand loved it, he enjoys off roading and scaring the crap out of me. Here are some pictures of the trail head and map of trails in San Rafael Wilderness in Los Padres National Forest.

<p> The Manzana Trail crosses though a lot of private land so make sure to follow the signs and close the gates behind you.</p>

<p>The Mazana Trail was flat most of the way the most challanging part was trying to keep my boots dry when crossing the 15+ creek crossings. I made it most of the way staying dry then...darn it, i got them wet when there was a creek 3ft deep. But the show must go on. Now, with squeeky boots we contnued down the trail making sure to stock up on water because we heard the Manazana School House Camp Ground only had one  small streem left. The only reason we knew about the streem was because of a passing hiker in the begining of the trip let us know. So bring a water filter or some sourse to clean the water</p>

<p>Seven miles into the trail you will find Dabney Cabin which is now a National Landmark.  The cabin as a old hunting lodge and now is a Santa Barbara historic landmark. They have a book for you to sign and it is fun reading the ghost stories about the hatchet man. Oooooooh...spooky</p>

<p>Besides the million flies attacking your face, the trail was beautiful, full of purple and yellow wild flowers, healthy green grass and graceful flowing creeks. We also came across some wild donkeys and horses, don't worry they are harmless.

<p>We got to the campsite around 1pm, dropped our packs, and started searching for the streem our fellow hiker told us about. But, before anything we had to check out the Manzana School House.  It was awesome going inside and seeing the chalk board, small windows and high barn like ceilings. Imagianing what it would be like to be in such a small class and looking out the window watching the wind blow through the trees.  Can you imagine what it would be like to live in the middle of the wilderness? Some history about the Manzana School House, it was last used around 1901 when there was a small community living in the area. Once the Sisquoc River dried out, they had no choice and were forced to leave.</p>

<p>The search for water was on but unfortunatly, no luck. The campsite was very well taken care, picnic tables, fire pits, and an outhouse facing the riverbed if you’re feeling risky, but no water.  It was a good thing we stocked up at the last creek which was about a mile and a half back. So, if you are going to camp be sure to stock up. Walking the dry river bed was a fun experience. The cracks in the sand were fascinating. </p>

<p>Once we were done searching for water, and exploring the site it was time to start a fire, watch the sun set and dinner. Whats for dinner you ask... Mac and Cheese with sundried tomatos, kielbasa and of course cholula.(hold for recipe in next blog) Food in the backcountry is AMAZING and guilt free because you just hiked 8 miled with 40lbs on your back. So no worries. And by the way, thats is choulula in a NyQuil container for zero spills. </p>

<p>Being the hardcore backpackers we are we decided to hit the Hurricane Deck Trail on the way home. Huricane Deck is Up 3000 feet in 4.2 miles where we hit Potrero Canyon Traill which it down 2.9 miles to the Manzana Creek Trail and lastly 1.3 miles back to Nira Cam Ground where we were parked.  The map was deciving because we had no idea we would be climbing up and down 20 peaks untill we hit the sign were the two trails meet. Thank goodness for the sign, as you can see below it didn’t say much….but we were happy when we saw it. There is also a picture of hurrican deck in the back, as you can see there are alot of small peaks. It was good times though, we laughed because after every one we were sure that it was the last one untill Potreo, but it wasn't. </p>

<p>Overall this was an awesome experience.  If you decide to take the Manzana Creek Trail round trip, or take Hurricane Deck back you will be happy you were there.</p>
