<h2 class="section-heading">Don't forget your sunglasses...no seriously don't</h2>

<p>My first ever backpacking trip was up 11,503 feet to San Gorgonio Peak. San Gorgonio is the tallest mountain in Southern California located in the San Bernardino National Forest and is also known as the "Old Greyback . We took this trip in late March of 2014 and were not thinking that there would be snow because living in Orange County it was 80 degrees at the time. There was alot of snow and because of the beaming sun there was alot more ice.  </p>

<p>There are alot of trails up to the peak but we decided to take Vivian Creek Trail which is less than 8 miles up to the peak. This is a difficult trail but a rewarding one. </p>

<p>We camped up at High Creek Camp and after oatmeal in the morning we were headed to the peak. Here is where it gets serious....</p>

<p> I look happy right. Well let me tell you I was very happy until we were driving home and I noticed I couldn't read traffic signs. (don't worry I was not driving) When we got home that night I could not close my eyes with out horrible pain.  I realized after looking down at my steps in the snow all morning the sun was hitting my eyes and literally burnt my eyeballs. Everything was a blur and any light would hurt my eyes.  Went to the doctor, they gave me drops and I had to hide in my boyfriends dark apartment for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Moral of the story is, even if you have a hat and you are hiking in the snow it is important to have sunglasses. Don't make the mistake that I did. Sunglasses are your friend. </p>
