<h2 class="section-heading">One stand night in San Gabriel. </h2> 

<p>Since San Gabriel is one of America's newest National monuments I decided to take a trip and see what beauty and wonder it holds.  I mean, it is a national monument, so it has to be pretty cool right?</p>

<p>I packed my hammock and loaded my bag for my first solo backpacking trip with the idea that at worst I would have to hike through one of Southern California's Storms of the year.  Which meant it might sprinkle for about 10 minutes. Let's be honest, 50% chance of rain and only .07 inches if does?! In southern California that might as well mean that it will be blue skies and not a cloud in sight.  But not this time, oh no not in the Angeles National Forest.   It was a sunny drive and a cloudy time getting out of the car, but as soon as I started on my 13 mile first day up Mount Wilson down to Spruce Grove Camp and up over Newcomb Pass it started to sprinkle.</p>

<p>Oh well, it won't last for more than 15 minutes.  The Winter Creek Trail was a beautiful hike, the mist that was building up reminded me of hiking through the redwoods back home.  After 4 miles up the Winter Creek Trail and things were getting moist. Every time I glanced down at my arm hair I had to brush the water off, as it was accumulating in a matter of seconds.  The view on the way up was nothing short of 50 feet due to the fact that I was walking in a rain cloud. When I summited and got to see the Mount Wilson observatory I took my time and checked out what I could while trying to stay out of the rain. The various telescopes and museums were pretty awesome, but I didn't want to spend too much time, it didn't look like the wetness was going to stop and I had miles to trek. </p>

<p>I originally planned to hike down the Ridge Trail, but I was sure I wasn't going to find anywhere to camp and the view was far from beautiful due to the limited visibility. So I decided to hike down the Sturtevant Trail. It was a steep decline, but the forest was more to look at than the gray 20 feet out in all directions.  The trail went by as fast as it came and I made it to the Gabrieleno Trail head at around 5:00.  The rain did not stop and everything was pretty wet, except for my feet.  Thank you waterproof boots.  Even though I was wearing shorts my socks were dry, and I was glad for that.  </p>

<br>

<p>When I start hoofing up the Gabrieleno Trail I quickly realized that this was a far less travelled trail. I figured this out by the overgrowth of grass hanging over the trail at about shin to knee hight.  And it was soaking wet! Goodbye dry feet! Every step knocked a cup of water off of the grass and poured it down my legs and into my boots.  At least it was 40 degrees and windy out! 2 and a quarter miles couldn't come quick enough, although it sure as hell took its time.  I finally found some ground that wasn't damn near vertical and had some trees to set up my hammock so I decided to set up camp.  Only problem was that I soon found out that I forgot my tarp to cover the hammock. </p>

<p>So now what.  It stopped raining somewhat but it was still very wet with the wind knocking all of the water out of the trees. I refrained from setting up camp and decided to drink some heated up water before I caught pneumonia.  I never thought hot water could taste so damn good. I mean like really, really good.  I only wish hot water tasted that good all the time.   Before the sun went down I saw a glimpse of sky and a parting of clouds.  Awesome! Now the wind will pick up due to the atmospheric pressure change and really make me warm and toasty.  I set up my hammock when I was sure it wouldn't get that wet under the trees and ate some dinner before I layed in my bad to try and warm my bones before sleeping.  </p>

<p>Have you ever heard a bark/hiss/scream/grunt in the middle of the night? And did it get closer and closer for about 5 minutes until it decides to get further for another 10 minutes.  Well I did, and boy howdy did it freak the crap out of me.  I was trying to convince myself that a bird could make that noise, although I knew that wasn't the case. After having that sound forever engrained in my psyche for the rest of my life and some googling the second I was home I discovered the answer to a question that the world has been asking for the past year.  A question every child in america has asked, only to receive gibberish for an answer. That question being, what does the fox say? Well let me tell you what, the fox say some scary sounding stuff at 2 in the morning in the middle of nowhere.  Have a listen below to get a glimpse of what I heard.  </p>

<p>After an hour of silence and enough time for my blood pressure to drop to safe levels I was able to catch some more sleep.  That was until natures most metal animal decided to wake me up.  I am speaking, of course, of the almighty woodpecker. Any animal that can bang its head like that is pretty metal in my book. </p>

<p>I hoped on the trail in 2 shakes of a lambs tail with my boots only slightly damp. I covered 8 miles in 2.5 hours on my way out, taking a detour and a lunch break to view the awesome Sturtevant falls. It itself isn't a far hike and I really recommend just hiking to that for anyone in Southern California. I was surprised of the amount of water that was coming down the water fall. And by that I mean I was surprised that there was any water coming down the waterfall at all. </p>

<p>All in all, I had a great time.  From carrying way to much water, being drenched head to toe, crapping my hammock in the middle of the night, and seeing how fast I could hike 8 miles I had a great time going solo in the woods.  It was nice to have things go quickly and to not have to wait.  Although I would of traded all of that freedom for some honest camaraderie.  </p>
