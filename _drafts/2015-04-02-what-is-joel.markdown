<h2 class="section-heading">What is Joel?</h2>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm Joel and I'm  here to tell you a little about myself.  Or maybe you'd rather know what makes me, well... me.  I'll stick to the latter because I think thats a more interesting of a question.  So where do I start... </p>

<p> I grew up in a military family and as such became acustomed to moving ever couple of years.  I was a pretty rebellious kid and just about every report card described me as, "intelligent but doesn't apply himself."  I've always wondered if they say that to every child.  Anyway ya!  You would regularly see me jumping the barbed wire military fencing to run into the woods and parks behind our houses.  So I guess you could say from the get go, I was pretty adventurous.</p>

<p>That all stopped once I started my college education at University of California San Diego where I went for a degree electrical engineering.  The adventurous rule breaker I had been throughout my childhood was replaced with someone that was wholly consume with how to make a 5 dollar footlong sub from subway last lunch and dinner and wondering how on earth V = I/R became so complicated (sorry that was an electrical engineering joke, not even a good one).</p>

<p>After spending 4 years practically living in a library I moved to Orange County and still, lived a pretty unadventurous life.  That is until I had the crazy idea of summiting Mount Rainier.  It was a decision that was made on a whim, in fact worse than that it was a story I was told about one of the founders of the company I was working for at the time, Rich Barton.  He had apparently summitted Mount Rainier though this is a heirsay, I can't say whether he did or didn't, its just what I was told.  Anyway, that set me on my adventure.</p>

<p>Shortly after this decision a good friend of mine, Stephen Bishtawi, invited me to go on a backpacking trip with one of his best friends from college.  That friend is Joseph Knox.  We did a three day stint in the Tahoe Basin where scaled a local peak and camped out in the snow.  It was so cold our shoe laces froze and we had to thaw them by the fire.  It was pretty nuts for my first trip into the back country in a long time.  I was hooked.</p>

<p>I ended up scaling Rainier, meeting Joanna Khachikian and many adventures have taken place since.</p>

<p>Topophi is an exciting project for me because we are solving a problem that we have had, but talking to other backpackers and hikers seems to be a challenge for everyone.  Its something I'm passionate about and am thrilled to see what we can do to make getting outdoors easier and safer for everyone.  I want to help people engage in nature and the outdoors.  I want to help build something that will allow everyone to have an adventure and even what they can do to help protect our most precious resource.</p>
